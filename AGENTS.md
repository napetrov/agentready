This repository is configured for autonomous agents working in Cursor.

Read these documents first:

- Architecture overview: [dev/ARCHITECTURE.md](dev/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Development guide and roadmap: [dev/DEVELOPMENT.md](dev/DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Operating Procedure
1. Read `dev/ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the system and constraints (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Vercel serverless).
2. Review `dev/DEVELOPMENT.md` for current status, coding standards, and roadmap.
3. Draft a brief plan before implementation. Keep edits small and reversible.
4. Implement with strict TypeScript, follow project structure, and maintain tests.
5. Verify with:
   - `npm run type-check`
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run build`
   - `npm test`
6. Document progress:
   - Add a progress note to `dev/DEVELOPMENT.md` (date, change, rationale, verification).
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` under [Unreleased] with Added/Changed/Fixed as applicable.
   - Update component-specific `agents.md` files (e.g., services/api/agents.md, services/worker/agents.md) when changes are localized.

## Environment & Secrets
- Use `.env.local` (never commit secrets). On Vercel, set env vars in project settings.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: required for production/runtime and any real API usage; optional for local tests (Jest uses mocks).
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: optional; needed only for GitHub API features.

## Testing & Safety
- Tests must pass locally with Jest. Use `__mocks__/openai.js`; do not call real APIs.
- Avoid large, breaking edits. Prefer incremental, typed changes with clear error handling.

## Deployment
- The app targets Vercel. Keep serverless constraints in mind (timeouts/memory).
- Do not introduce long-running synchronous operations in API routes.
